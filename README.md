# dotfiles

Compilation of my favorite dotfiles from various sources throughout GitHub.
Most of the files are taken from
[Mathiasâ€™s dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).

## Installation

Clone the repo and run the bootstrap script `./bootstrap.sh` or pick and choose
the parts that you like.

## Components

- macOS settings
- Zsh with [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
- Vim with [Dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)
- Tmux
- [Go](https://golang.org/)

## Important Notes

- Running the bootstrap script will override your dotfiles
- The macOS settigns script might require a restart for changes to be applied
