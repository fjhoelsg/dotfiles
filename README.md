# dotfiles

Compilation of my favorite dotfiles from various sources throughout GitHub.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run the bootstrap script `./bootstrap.sh` or pick and choose
the parts that you like.

## Components

- OS X settings
- Zsh with [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
- Vim with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- Tmux
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/)

## Important Notes

- Running the bootstrap script will override your dotfiles
- The OS X settigns script might require a restart for changes to be applied
